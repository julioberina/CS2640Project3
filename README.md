# CS 2640 Project 3

The purpose of this project is to gather inputs and store them into
an array in a sorted manner.  In other words, swaps are done to 
ensure that the array remains sorted per insertion.

Next, it repeatedly asks the user for values and does a recursive
binary search on the sorted array.  It returns 1 when found and
0 when not found.
